# URLify - Modern URL Shortener

A fully client-side URL shortener built using Vite+React, TypeScript, and `localStorage`. This project enables you to generate short, shareable links and track their usage statistics. It also supports smooth scrolling between sections and redirection from shortened URLs to their original destinations.

---

## Features

- **Shorten URLs**: Transform long URLs into concise, memorable links.
- **Analytics**: Track the number of clicks for each shortened URL.
- **Local Storage**: No backend required; all data is stored in the browser's `localStorage`.
- **Redirection**: Shortened URLs dynamically redirect to the original destination.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Navigate between app sections using smooth scrolling.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-url-shortener.git
    cd react-url-shortener
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server**:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Enter a long URL in the input field.
2. Click the "Shorten" button to generate a short URL.
3. Copy the short URL and share it with others.
4. Visit the short URL to be redirected to the original URL.

---

## Navigation

- **Home**: Transform URLs and view analytics.
- **Sections**:
    - `Hero Section`: Introductory content and URL shortener form.
    - `URL List`: View all shortened URLs and copy links.
    - `Analytics`: Track click counts for each link.

---

## How It Works

1. **Short URL Generation**:

    - A unique ID is generated for each original URL.
    - The shortened URL format is: `https://urlify1.netlify.app/#/unique-id`.

2. **Redirection**:

    - When a shortened URL is visited, the app fetches the original URL from `localStorage` and redirects.

3. **Smooth Scrolling**:
    - The app uses `react-router-hash-link` for smooth navigation between sections.
